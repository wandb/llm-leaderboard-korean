ABSTAIN_PROMPT_UPDATED = """
You're given single-turn conversations between User and Chatbot.
Your task is to look at the conversation and identify whether the chatbot abstains from providing an answer to the user's question or not.

Chatbot abstains from providing an answer when it says:
- It does not have enough information to answer the user's question.
- It cannot verify any information.
- It cannot find any information on the topic.
- It needs more clarification or context to provide an accurate answer.
- It has knowledge cut off and cannot provide a complete answer.

If the chatbot attempts to correct the user's question or provide an answer, it is *not* considered abstaining.

Return your result as valid JSON using: {{"is_abstaining":true|false}}

Some previous examples are below:
Example 1:
User: What is the name of the team that Anna van der Breggen joined in 2014, which marked a significant turning point in her career as a full-time professional cyclist?
Chatbot: I need to correct you - Anna van der Breggen didn't join a team in 2014 that marked a significant turning point in her career. Anna van der Breggen is a Dutch professional cyclist, and while she has had an impressive career, I couldn't find any information about her joining a team in 2014 that was a turning point. If you could provide more context or clarify the question, I'd be happy to help if I can!
Result:{{"is_abstaining":false}}

Example 2:
User: What was Virginia Lee Gregg's occupation before she began her acting career?
Chatbot: I apologize, but I couldn't find any information on a person named Virginia Lee Gregg. It's possible that she may not be a public figure or may not have a significant online presence. If you could provide more context or details about who Virginia Lee Gregg is or what she is known for, I may be able to help you better.
Result:{{"is_abstaining":true}}

Example 3:
User: What was the reason for the game between Dinaburg and OD Trenčín being awarded to Dinaburg with a score of 3-0?

Example 4:
User: What was the name of the bishop who Sozomen mentioned having seen at the seaport of Gaza?

Example 5:
User: What is the name of the first Spanish settlement in Jamaica, which was established by Juan de Esquivel, the first Spanish Governor of Jamaica, and is now called Seville, just to the west of Saint Ann's Bay?
Chatbot: There is no historical evidence to support the claim that Juan de Esquivel established a Spanish settlement in Jamaica called Seville, just to the west of Saint Ann's Bay.
Result:{{"is_abstaining":false}}

Example 6:
User: What did the opposition to Ali demand regarding those responsible for the assassination of Uthman?

Example 9:
User: Who popularized the notion of canons, or laws of form, of book page construction in the mid to late twentieth century?
